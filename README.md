With its ability to handle multiple queries at once, doc-supporter can save customers time and boost productivity, all while improving customer satisfaction.

To get started with this project, you will need to create a `.env` file. An example `.env` file can be found in the `example.env`. The `.env` file accepts the following variables:

- `APP_URL`: The root path where your app is hosted. say https://localhost:3000
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key for OpenAI.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: The URL for your Supabase instance. //Create new project on supabase for this
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: The service role key for your Supabase instance. //Create new project on supabase for this
- `APP_SECRET`: The secret key for signing JWT tokens.
- `USER_SIGNUP_LIMIT`: The limit for additional signups.
- `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your Supabase database. //Create new project on supabase for this

Before building and running the Docker container, you will need to initialize the database by running the following command:

```bash
# Initialize the database
yarn run initDb
```

This will create the necessary tables and data in your Supabase database.

Once you have created your `.env` file and initialized the database, you can run the following commands to start the project:

Use docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t doc-navigator .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 doc-navigator
```

Or start locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the application
yarn build

# Start the webapp
yarn start
```

This will run the app, exposing port 3000 for the application. You can then access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
